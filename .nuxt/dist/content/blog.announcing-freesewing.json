It really is.\nWhat’s hard is getting things to fit properly.\nThat’s why you use a sewing pattern.\nIt’s a blueprint for whatever it is you are making.\nA good pattern gives you good fit. Most patterns don’t.</p>\n<p>That’s because — much like clothes in the shop — patterns come in sizes.\nAnd sizes are a crude way to put people in boxes.\nThey are made for an imaginary average person, rather than for you.</p>\n<p>There’s another way, and that is to draft a pattern based on your measurements.\nThese made-to-measure patterns are vastly superior, but they require a lot of work.</p>\n<p>I wanted to change that, and that effort evolved into\n<a href=\"https://makemypattern.com/\">MakeMyPattern.com</a>.\nI ran that site for a number of years, and it was a remarkable success.\nProbably helped by the fact that I gave away all patterns for free.</p>\n<p>In the world of home sewing, it tends to require a bit of\nexplaining why one would choose to give away their work for free.\nThings are different in the open source world where the idea of\nsharing your work with others for the benefit of all is\nthe very thread from which communities are woven.</p>\n<p>While I can’t magically bring the culture of open source\nto sewing patterns, I certainly can bring sewing patterns\ninto the open source world.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://freesewing.org/\">Freesewing.org</a> will continue to offer what\n<a href=\"https://makemypattern.com/\">Makemypattern.com</a> does today:\nfree sewing patterns drafted to your measurements.\nBut additionally, it will be open to your contributions.</p>\n<p>Here’s hoping that in the Venn diagram of the somewhat geeky and sewing,\nit’s not just me in the middle.</p>\n<p>joost</p>\n<h2>Shout-outs</h2>\n<p>Freesewing is a project by <a href=\"https://github.com/joostdecock\">Joost De Cock</a> and contributors.</p>\n<p>Hat-tip to <a href=\"https://github.com/jakesgordon\">@jakesgordon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.kevlindev.com\">Kevin Lindsey</a> for allowing me to port some of their code.</p>\n<p>The early-stage enthusiasm and input of\n<a href=\"https://github.com/diggydev\">@diggydev</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/cabi\">@cabi</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/woutervdub\">@woutervdub</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/cloutiy\">@cloutiy</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/straytaoist\">@straytaoist</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/netpraxis\">@netpraxis</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Stefan1960\">@Stefan1960</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/brendare1\">@brendare1</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/JorisJoppe\">@JorisJoppe</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/JamJenkins\">@JamJenkins</a>, and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/fightingrabbit\">@fightingrabbit</a> has been a great boon to this project.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/annekecaramin\">@annekecaramin</a> for designing a logo cool enough to put on a Tshirt.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scorchtorch\">@scorchtorch</a> for being the best at that heart/salad/antlers thing.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, this project would not exist without the users, supporters, and donors of <a href=\"https://makemypattern.com/\">makemypattern.com</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks guys!</p>\n"
